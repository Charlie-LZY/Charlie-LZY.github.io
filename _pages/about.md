Hello there! I am a senior student from [College of Information and Electrical Engineering](https://ciee.cau.edu.cn/) at China Agricultural University, majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. Currently, I am working as a research intern at [Intelligent Information Processing and Advanced Control Software Technology Research Team](https://thuiar.github.io/) in Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Hua Xu](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1122/3562.htm).

My current research focuses on multimodal sentiment analysis and its interpretability. I am also broadly interested in natural language processing and  game theory.
